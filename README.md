## File manager
##### The program is started by npm-script start in following way:
  > npm run start -- --username=your_username

##### List of operations and their syntax:

* **Navigation & working directory (nwd)**

  * Go upper from current directory (when you are in the root folder this operation shouldn't change working directory)
  > up

  * Go to dedicated folder from current directory (path_to_directory can be relative or absolute)
  > cd path_to_directory

  * List all files and folder in current directory and print it to console
  > ls

* **Basic operations with files**
  * Read file and print it's content in console:
  > cat path_to_file

  * Create empty file in current working directory:
  > add new_file_name

  * Rename file:
  > rn path_to_file new_filename

  * Copy file:
  > cp path_to_file path_to_new_directory

  * Move file (same as copy but initial file is deleted):
  > mv path_to_file path_to_new_directory

  * Delete file:
  > rm path_to_file

* **Operating system info (prints following information in console)**
  * Get EOL (default system End-Of-Line)
  > os --EOL

  * Get host machine CPUs info (overall amount of CPUS plus model and clock rate (in GHz) for each of them)
  > os --cpus

  * Get home directory:
  > os --homedir

  * Get current system user name (Do not confuse with the username that is set when the application starts)
  > os --username

  * Get CPU architecture for which Node.js binary has compiled
  > os --architecture

* **Hash calculation**
  * Calculate hash for file and print it into console
  > hash path_to_file

* **Compress and decompress operations**
  * Compress file (using Brotli algorytm)
  > compress path_to_file path_to_destination

  * Decompress file (using Brotli algorytm)
  > decompress path_to_file path_to_destination
